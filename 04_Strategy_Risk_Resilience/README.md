## Purpose
This folder contains **executive-level governance artifacts** that connect technical controls to business risk, regulatory expectations, and strategic maturity.

It is designed to answer three questions quickly:
1. **What risks matter most?**
2. **Which controls mitigate those risks?**
3. **How does governance mature over time?**

## Contents

### 📘 Executive Risk Register
**`Executive_Risk_Register.md`**

- Identifies material enterprise risks across Identity, Cloud Security, and FinOps  
- Maps each risk directly to implemented proof packs  
- Designed for board review, audit walkthroughs, and leadership briefings  

---

### 📘 NIST 800-53 Master Control Matrix
**`NIST_800-53_Control_Matrix.md`**

- Maps technical implementations to NIST SP 800-53 control families  
- Serves as the primary audit navigation document  
- Demonstrates control coverage and evidence traceability  

---

### 📘 Identity & Governance Maturity Roadmap
**`Identity_Maturity_Roadmap.md`**

- Defines a realistic 6-month progression from baseline to mature governance  
- Balances security, operations, audit readiness, and financial accountability  
- Shows sequencing, not just end state  

---

## Governance Philosophy
- Controls exist to **reduce risk**, not generate documentation.
- Evidence is produced as a **byproduct of operations**, not manual effort.
- Governance is most effective when it aligns identity, security, and finance.
- Maturity is incremental, measurable, and defensible.

---

## How to Use This Folder
- **Executives:** Review risk posture and maturity trajectory.
- **Auditors:** Trace risks to controls to evidence.
- **Engineers:** Understand why controls exist and how they fit together.
